In this problem, we are asked to find the dat file sent by the hactivist group and the ip address of Terry Colby. So, before all that , Mr.Robot is tv-series based on hacking and other digital crimes. Here we can just search for the dat file sent to Evil Corps (Yes I know, how weird it sounds ). So, we just google the dat file name

And just like that we found the dat file name which is fsociety00.dat
Now we just search Terry Colby's IP address.

And since we also found his IP address 218.108. 149.373
So, the flag is VishwaCTF{fsociety00.dat_218.108.149.373}
