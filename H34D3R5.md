In this problem from web category, we are asked to modify the request headers. So, I used an extension called mod header. Let's get started.
At first we were asked to come from lorbrowser.

So, we use the Mod header to edit our User-Agent as lorbrowser.

Now, we are told that wlmac people come from the vishwactf.com web , so we edit our Referer as https://vishwactf.com/

And the requirements keep getting crazier as they are asking to change our time to 20 years far from now. That's why we just change the Date header to 2044

Now, they are saying that we need to set our Upgrade-Insecure_Requests to 10. So , I found this header after I googled  client preference for an encrypted and authenticated response.

Here comes the last challenge where we have to set the Downlink header to 999999999 according to the hint Nine times (9) also I found the Downlink header by searching the hint a little which was  "approximate bandwidth of the clients connection to the server"

And this is the end of this problem
