This is a problem from OSINT category. Here we are told to find one of the Tryhackme profile of a member of VishwaCTF who is in top 3%. So at first we go to Vishwactf.com , after that we click on Our Heroes for the information of the members in the above left.

 Then we see the members with their linkedin id and etc. Here I would suggest to check the core members linkedin at first. So, after checking one of the profile Ankush Kaudi,

We go to his linkedin profile and we can see that he is one of the top 3% in tryhackme.

Then we search his using the modified tryhackme profile url according to his name.
